# Gathered and Empowered

 Gathered and Empowered serves as a resourceful and accessible app tailored to the needs of immigrants. As a child of immigrants and coming from non-profit work, it was imperative for me to build this passion project. With the use of MVC, JavaScript/Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, EJS, Bootstrap, and some great open-source resources, I put together an app that allows users to translate their pdf, connect with other community members through video virtual chatrooms and keep track of their progress
